# Mastering PostgreSQL 

These repository contains my notes from the course [Mastering PostgreSQL](https://masteringpostgres.com/) by Aaron Francis.

## What to expect from the course
This course is designed to take you from beginner to expert in Postgres. You'll learn how to use Postgres in production, how to optimize it, and how to use advanced features like full text search, vectors and advanced techniques for working with JSON.

Mastering Postgres is a comprehensive video course that will help you level up your applications and your career. Start with the fundamentals and work your way up to advanced topics like indexes and data types.

## Important note
Although PostgreSQL is a great database solution. It isn't the perfect solution for every single use case out there.

PostgreSQL is highly extensible, performance, and feature-rich, with constant updates that improve its functionality but in many cases, there are other tools that are better then it so don't think of it as a silver bullet.
